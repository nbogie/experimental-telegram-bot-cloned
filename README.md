# Telegram bot example

This is an extension of Faraz Patankar's example.  Mostly it adds a lot of different example responses to that small demo.

It integrates most of the extended examples at https://github.com/nbogie/telegram-parlour-games-bot

This example starts a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot on an [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) server.
